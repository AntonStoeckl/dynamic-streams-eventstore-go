## âœ… Completed

### OpenTelemetry-Compatible Contextual Logging (Dependency-Free)
- **Completed**: 2025-08-02
- **Description**: Complete observability triad with context-aware logging following the same dependency-free pattern as metrics and tracing
- **Features**: 
  - ContextualLogger interface using only standard library types for maximum flexibility
  - Automatic trace correlation when tracing is enabled - logs include span context automatically
  - Complete instrumentation of Query and Append operations with contextual logging
  - Dual logging support - traditional Logger and ContextualLogger work simultaneously
  - TestContextualLogger with comprehensive testing infrastructure
  - Zero dependencies - users integrate with any logging backend (OpenTelemetry, structured loggers)
  - Example implementation showing OpenTelemetry integration patterns
  - Backward compatible - existing Logger interface unchanged

### Observability Code Readability Improvements
- **Completed**: 2025-08-02  
- **Description**: Significant code readability improvements using observer patterns to reduce observability noise
- **Features**:
  - Metrics observer pattern - simplified metrics recording with queryMetricsObserver and appendMetricsObserver
  - Tracing observer pattern - encapsulated span lifecycle management
  - Reduced postgres.go complexity - observability calls simplified from 6+ calls to 2-3 simple observer calls
  - Maintained identical functionality - zero breaking changes to external API
  - Consistent patterns - all observability follows same observer pattern for maintainability

### Distributed Tracing Support (Dependency-Free)
- **Completed**: 2025-08-01
- **Description**: Comprehensive distributed tracing following the same dependency-free pattern as existing metrics
- **Features**: 
  - TracingCollector and SpanContext interfaces using only standard library types
  - Complete instrumentation of Query and Append operations with span context propagation
  - Full error tracking with detailed error classification and span status codes
  - TestTracingCollector with fluent assertion interface for comprehensive testing
  - Zero dependencies - users integrate with any tracing backend (OpenTelemetry, Jaeger, Zipkin)
  - Production-ready with proper concurrency safety and optional tracing via functional options

### OpenTelemetry-Compatible Metrics Collection
- **Completed**: 2025-01-31
- **Description**: Comprehensive metrics instrumentation with duration, counters, and error tracking
- **Features**: 
  - MetricsCollector interface
  - Automatic metrics collection for all operations
  - OpenTelemetry-compatible labels and conventions
  - Complete test suite with TestMetricsCollector
  - Full documentation coverage
