# In Progress

This file tracks tasks that are currently active in the Dynamic Event Streams EventStore project.

## Performance Testing and Next-Level Optimization
- **Started**: 2025-08-07  
- **Priority**: Medium - System stability achieved, exploring higher performance limits
- **Objective**: Test autovacuum optimizations and identify next bottlenecks for pushing beyond 250 req/sec sustainable performance

### Root Cause Analysis Complete ✅
**Problem**: Load generator at 300 req/sec experiencing context deadline exceeded timeouts

**Key Findings from Database Statistics**:
- **Resource Allocation Mismatch**: Replica (handling 3.1x more load) has 2.3x less memory than master
- **Connection Imbalance**: Replica: 81 connections vs Master: 18 connections (4.5x difference)
- **Load Distribution**: Replica 950K commits vs Master 303K commits due to read/write splitting
- **Read/Write Pattern**: All SELECT queries route to replica (3GB), all INSERT to master (7GB)

**Database Statistics Summary**:
```
MASTER (7GB, port 5433):  18 connections, 303K commits, 100% cache hit, under-utilized
REPLICA (3GB, port 5434): 81 connections, 950K commits, 100% cache hit, over-loaded
REPLICATION: 8ms lag, healthy streaming replication, 0.139s behind master
```

**PostgreSQL Specialist Analysis**: 
- Connection pool exhaustion on replica (81 connections with 3GB RAM)
- Memory pressure from connection overhead (~5-10MB per connection)
- Resource allocation inverse to actual load pattern
- Both pools configured for 200 max connections but load heavily read-biased

### Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1: Memory Reallocation (In Progress)
**Objective**: Swap memory allocation to match actual load distribution
- **Master**: 7GB → 4GB (sufficient for write workload)
- **Replica**: 3GB → 6GB (needed for heavy read workload)
- **Docker Configuration**: Update docker-compose.yml memory limits
- **PostgreSQL Tuning**: Update shared_buffers, effective_cache_size, work_mem accordingly
- **Expected Impact**: 40-60% improvement in query response times

#### Phase 2: Connection Pool Optimization (Future)
**Objective**: Reduce connection pressure on replica
- Replica: 200 → 40 max connections
- Master: 200 → 20 max connections  
- **Expected Impact**: 30-50% reduction in connection timeouts

#### Phase 3: Configuration Fine-tuning (Future)
**Objective**: Optimize PostgreSQL settings for read vs write workloads
- Replica: Optimize for concurrent reads, larger work_mem, query-friendly settings
- Master: Optimize for writes, WAL settings, checkpoint tuning
- **Expected Impact**: 20-30% overall performance improvement

### Current Status
- ✅ **Investigation Complete**: Comprehensive database statistics gathered from master and replica
- ✅ **Root Cause Identified**: Resource allocation mismatch and connection pool imbalance
- ✅ **Specialist Analysis**: PostgreSQL performance expert provided detailed optimization plan  
- ✅ **Phase 1 Implementation**: Memory reallocation completed (4GB master, 6GB replica)
- ✅ **Configuration Validation**: New PostgreSQL settings applied and verified
- ✅ **Replication Status**: Streaming replication working normally after restart

### Files Modified ✅
- ✅ `testutil/postgresengine/docker-compose.yml` - Updated memory limits (Master: 4096M, Replica: 6144M)
- ✅ `testutil/postgresengine/tuning/benchmarkdb-master-postgresql.conf` - Updated for 4GB allocation
  - shared_buffers: 1024MB, effective_cache_size: 2400MB, work_mem: 64MB, maintenance_work_mem: 256MB
- ✅ `testutil/postgresengine/tuning/benchmarkdb-replica-postgresql.conf` - Updated for 6GB allocation  
  - shared_buffers: 1536MB, effective_cache_size: 3600MB, work_mem: 96MB, maintenance_work_mem: 384MB

### Verification Completed ✅
- **Memory Configuration**: All PostgreSQL settings correctly applied and verified
- **Container Health**: All containers healthy and running
- **Replication Status**: Streaming replication active (state: streaming, sync_state: async)
- **Resource Allocation**: Master now has 4GB (sufficient for writes), Replica has 6GB (needed for heavy reads)

### Success Criteria
- Load generator runs at 300 req/sec without timeout errors
- Connection distribution balanced appropriately
- Both databases maintain 100% cache hit ratio
- Replication lag remains under 10ms
- Overall query response time improvement of 40%+

## Go Load Generator Architecture Bottleneck Resolution
- **Started**: 2025-08-07
- **Priority**: Critical - Root cause of timeout issues identified  
- **Objective**: Replace goroutine explosion pattern with worker pool architecture to eliminate PostgreSQL "ClientRead" waiting

### Root Cause Analysis Complete ✅
**Problem**: Load generator architectural issue causing database performance bottlenecks

**Key Findings from Go Architecture Analysis**:
- **Goroutine Explosion**: 300 req/sec × 5s timeout = up to 1,500 concurrent goroutines
- **Connection Pool Starvation**: 1,500 goroutines competing for 400 total connections (200 primary + 200 replica)  
- **Resource Contention**: Goroutines block waiting for database connections before reaching PostgreSQL
- **Memory Pressure**: ~12MB overhead just from goroutine stacks

**PostgreSQL Evidence Confirms Go Client Issues**:
```
Database Side: 97 processes waiting on "ClientRead" - DB ready, client not sending requests
Query Performance: Negative durations (very recent queries) - individual queries fast
Connection Locks: 223 AccessShareLocks - connections established but goroutines queuing  
Cache Performance: 99.99% hit ratio - database performing excellently
```

**Go Architecture Expert Analysis**:
- Spawn-per-request anti-pattern killing performance
- Connection pool exhaustion causing client-side queuing delays
- 5-second timeouts preventing fast failure and resource cleanup
- PostgreSQL waiting for Go application to send requests (not the other way around)

### Implementation Plan

#### Worker Pool Architecture (Complete Replacement)
**Objective**: Replace spawn-per-request with bounded worker pool pattern
- **Fixed Worker Count**: 50 workers (aligned with connection capacity)
- **Bounded Request Queue**: Prevents memory leaks during overload
- **Backpressure Handling**: Fast failure when system at capacity
- **Resource Alignment**: Worker count matches connection pool size
- **Faster Timeouts**: 1-second operation timeout for quick failure detection

#### Expected Performance Impact
**Current (Broken)**:
- Goroutines: 1,500 potential concurrent
- Memory: ~12MB goroutine stack overhead  
- Connection ratio: 1,500:400 (3.75:1 severe contention)
- Result: PostgreSQL "ClientRead" waiting, timeout errors

**Worker Pool (Fixed)**:
- Goroutines: 50 fixed workers
- Memory: ~400KB goroutine stack overhead
- Connection ratio: 50:400 (1:8 healthy utilization)
- Result: Steady database utilization, no client bottlenecks

### Files to Modify
- `example/demo/cmd/load-generator/load_generator.go` - Complete architectural rewrite
- Worker pool pattern with bounded concurrency and request queuing
- Backpressure metrics and proper resource management

### Implementation Complete ✅
- ✅ **Worker Pool Architecture**: Replaced spawn-per-request with 50 fixed workers
- ✅ **Bounded Request Queue**: 100-slot queue prevents memory leaks during overload
- ✅ **Backpressure Handling**: Fast failure when system at capacity with metrics
- ✅ **Faster Timeouts**: Reduced from 5 seconds to 1 second for quick failure detection
- ✅ **Resource Alignment**: Worker count (50) aligned with connection pool capacity
- ✅ **Enhanced Logging**: Added backpressure metrics and queue depth monitoring
- ✅ **Build Verification**: Code compiles successfully and ready for testing

### Architecture Changes Made
**Before (Goroutine Explosion)**:
```go
case <-lg.ticker.C:
    lg.wg.Add(1)
    go lg.executeScenario(ctx)  // New goroutine per request
```

**After (Worker Pool)**:
```go
// Fixed 50 workers process requests from bounded queue
for i := 0; i < lg.workerCount; i++ {
    go lg.worker(ctx, i)
}

// Rate-limited request generation (no goroutine spawning)
case <-ticker.C:
    request := lg.generateRequest(ctx)
    select {
    case lg.requestQueue <- request:  // Queue request
    default:
        lg.recordBackpressure()       // Fast failure
    }
```

### Expected Performance Impact
- **Goroutines**: 1,500 potential → 50 fixed workers (97% reduction)
- **Memory**: ~12MB → ~400KB goroutine overhead (97% reduction)  
- **Connection Ratio**: 3.75:1 contention → 1:8 healthy utilization
- **PostgreSQL**: Eliminate "ClientRead" waiting, steady request flow

### Success Criteria ✅ (Partial Success)
- ✅ Eliminate goroutine explosion (1,500 → 50 concurrent operations)
- ✅ Eliminate PostgreSQL "ClientRead" waiting pattern
- ⚠️ **Achieved ~250 req/sec stable** (target was 300, but system limit reached)
- ✅ Reduce memory overhead by 97% (~12MB → ~400KB)
- ✅ Maintain target request rate with bounded resource usage

### Performance Results
- **250 req/s**: 251.4 req/s, 0.2% errors, 15.5% backpressure - **STABLE**
- **260 req/s**: 224.8 req/s, 0.2% errors, 12.9% backpressure - Performance degrading
- **230 req/s**: 220.7 req/s, 0.2% errors, 3.3% backpressure - Low backpressure

**Current database size**: 447,955 events

## Autovacuum Optimization for EventStore Workload
- **Started**: 2025-08-07
- **Priority**: High - Periodic timeout spikes and performance degradation with growing database
- **Objective**: Tune autovacuum for append-only EventStore workload to eliminate blocking and improve consistent performance

### Performance Issues Identified
- **Periodic Timeout Spikes**: Every couple of minutes on Grafana, not fixed interval
- **Append Operations Affected**: Timeouts almost exclusively on Append() operations (writes to master)
- **Performance Degradation**: 250+ req/s shows declining performance as database grows (447K events)
- **Autovacuum Blocking**: Write operations blocked during vacuum cycles

### EventStore-Specific Autovacuum Requirements
**Key Insight**: EventStore has unique characteristics requiring different autovacuum strategy:

1. **No DELETE Operations**: Pure append-only workload (except manual cleanup in tests)
2. **Minimal Dead Tuples**: Very few dead tuples generated during normal operations
3. **High INSERT Rate**: Continuous event appends create many new tuples
4. **Query Performance Critical**: ANALYZE needs to run frequently for JSONB query optimization
5. **Write Blocking Unacceptable**: Vacuum blocking Append() operations causes timeouts

### Proposed Autovacuum Tuning Strategy

#### Master Database (Write-Heavy)
**Minimize vacuum frequency, maximize ANALYZE frequency:**
```sql
-- Vacuum rarely (minimal dead tuples in append-only)
autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor = 0.8    # Only vacuum at 80% dead tuples (vs current 10%)
autovacuum_naptime = 2min               # Check more frequently but vacuum rarely
autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay = 2ms      # Faster vacuum when it does run (vs 10ms)
autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit = 8000     # Higher throughput during vacuum (vs 2000)

-- Analyze frequently (critical for JSONB query planning)  
autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor = 0.02  # Analyze at 2% changed tuples (vs 5%)
```

#### Replica Database (Read-Heavy)
**Minimal vacuum, frequent ANALYZE for query optimization:**
```sql
-- Even less vacuum (read-only, no new dead tuples)
autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor = 0.9    # Almost never vacuum
autovacuum_naptime = 10min              # Less frequent checks

-- More frequent ANALYZE (query performance critical)
autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor = 0.05  # Analyze at 5% changed tuples (vs 10%)
```

### Implementation Plan
1. **Update master autovacuum settings** for append-only workload
2. **Update replica autovacuum settings** for read optimization  
3. **Test performance** at 250-300 req/s to verify timeout elimination
4. **Monitor Grafana** for elimination of periodic timeout spikes

### Expected Impact
- **Eliminate periodic timeout spikes** caused by autovacuum blocking writes
- **Improve write consistency** by reducing vacuum-induced blocking
- **Maintain query performance** through frequent ANALYZE of JSONB indexes
- **Enable sustained 300+ req/s** without autovacuum interference
