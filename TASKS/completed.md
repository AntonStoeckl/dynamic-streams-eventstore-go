# Completed Tasks

This file tracks completed work for the Dynamic Event Streams EventStore project across multiple development sessions.

## Read/Write Database Splitting Implementation
- **Completed**: 2025-08-07
- **Description**: Successfully implemented read/write database splitting across all database adapters to enable query routing to read replicas while maintaining write operations on primary database
- **Problem Solved**: EventStore lacked ability to scale read operations independently from write operations, limiting performance under high query loads
- **Technical Achievement**:
  - **Multi-Adapter Support**: Implemented replica functionality in all three adapters (pgx.Pool, sql.DB, sqlx.DB) with consistent patterns
  - **Query Routing Logic**: SELECT queries automatically route to replica when available, INSERT/UPDATE operations always use primary database
  - **Clean Constructor Pattern**: Added `NewEventStoreFromPGXPoolAndReplica()`, `NewEventStoreFromSQLDBAndReplica()`, `NewEventStoreFromSQLXAndReplica()` constructors
  - **Adapter-Level Implementation**: Each adapter handles routing internally, maintaining clean separation of concerns
  - **Production Deployment**: Implementation already in use with load generator for real-world testing
- **Implementation Completed**:
  - ✅ **PGX Adapter**: Added `replicaPool *pgxpool.Pool` field and Query() routing logic in `eventstore/postgresengine/internal/adapters/pgx_adapter.go`
  - ✅ **SQL Adapter**: Added `replicaDB *sql.DB` field and Query() routing logic in `eventstore/postgresengine/internal/adapters/sql_adapter.go`
  - ✅ **SQLX Adapter**: Added `replicaDB *sqlx.DB` field and Query() routing logic in `eventstore/postgresengine/internal/adapters/sqlx_adapter.go`
  - ✅ **EventStore Constructors**: Added replica constructors in `eventstore/postgresengine/postgres.go` with functional options support
  - ✅ **Benchmark Test Fix**: Fixed NULL scan error in `testutil/postgresengine/helper/postgreswrapper/wrapper.go` using COALESCE
  - ✅ **Production Usage**: Load generator successfully using read/write splitting with `NewEventStoreFromPGXPoolAndReplica()`
- **Files Modified**:
  - `eventstore/postgresengine/internal/adapters/pgx_adapter.go` - Added replica pool field and Query() routing logic
  - `eventstore/postgresengine/internal/adapters/sql_adapter.go` - Added replica DB field and Query() routing logic  
  - `eventstore/postgresengine/internal/adapters/sqlx_adapter.go` - Added replica DB field and Query() routing logic
  - `eventstore/postgresengine/postgres.go` - Added `NewEventStoreFromPGXPoolAndReplica()`, `NewEventStoreFromSQLDBAndReplica()`, `NewEventStoreFromSQLXAndReplica()` constructors
  - `testutil/postgresengine/helper/postgreswrapper/wrapper.go` - Fixed NULL scan error with COALESCE for empty events table
- **Important Architectural Considerations**:
  - **Replica Lag Impact**: Read replica has inherent replication lag which could affect Query() operations timing
  - **Potential Concurrency Conflicts**: Splitting Query()/Append() routing may increase concurrency conflicts due to stale reads from lagged replica
  - **Business Decision Risk**: Stale reads from replica might theoretically impact command handling business decisions (low probability but requires monitoring)  
  - **Retry Strategy**: Increased concurrency conflicts might be acceptable with proper retry logic implementation (see ready-to-implement tasks)
  - **Production Monitoring**: Requires careful monitoring of replication lag, conflict rates, and business logic correctness
- **Production Benefits**:
  - **Read Scaling**: Query operations can scale independently from write operations using dedicated replica
  - **Load Distribution**: Separates read and write workloads across different database instances
  - **Performance Isolation**: Heavy query workloads don't impact write performance on primary database
  - **Future Foundation**: Architecture ready for multiple read replicas and advanced scaling patterns
- **Architecture**: EventStore automatically routes Query() to replica (port 5434) and Append() to primary (port 5433) when replica is available
- **Load Generator**: Successfully implemented and tested with realistic workloads, though throughput improvements not yet observed

## Domain Event Predicate Structure Consistency Fixes
- **Completed**: 2025-08-09  
- **Description**: Fixed critical inconsistency where failed domain events used generic `EntityID` instead of proper business identifiers, causing 95% failure rates in load generator due to predicate mismatches
- **Problem Solved**: Failed events were using `EntityID` field while command handlers queried using `BookID`/`ReaderID` predicates, resulting in failed events being invisible during Query operations and causing unrealistic failure cascades
- **Technical Achievement**:
  - **Domain Event Structure Consistency**: Updated all 3 failed domain events to use proper business identifiers matching successful events
  - **Command Handler Integration**: Fixed all BuildXXXFailed function calls with correct parameter mappings and time conversions  
  - **Event Deserialization Fix**: Updated domain event conversion logic to handle new field names in event payloads
  - **Build System Validation**: Ensured all changes compile correctly and maintain existing functionality
  - **Performance Impact**: Dramatic reduction in artificial failure rates enabling realistic load testing scenarios
- **Failed Events Updated**:
  - `LendingBookToReaderFailed`: Changed from `EntityID` to `BookID + ReaderID` fields for proper business entity identification
  - `ReturningBookFromReaderFailed`: Updated to use `BookID + ReaderID` instead of generic `EntityID`  
  - `RemovingBookFromCirculationFailed`: Changed from `EntityID` to `BookID` field for book-specific failures
- **Command Handler Fixes**:
  - `lendbookcopytoreader/decide.go`: Updated `BuildLendingBookToReaderFailed` calls with proper parameter order and time conversion
  - `returnbookcopyfromreader/decide.go`: Fixed function signature and parameter mapping for failed event creation
  - `removebookcopy/decide.go`: Updated `BuildRemovingBookFromCirculationFailed` calls to use `BookID` instead of `EntityID`
- **Infrastructure Fixes**:
  - `domain_event_from_storable_event.go`: Updated event deserialization to use new field names (`BookID`/`ReaderID` instead of `EntityID`)
  - Added missing import statements in all affected files after structural changes
- **Load Generator Impact**:
  - **Before**: 95% failure events due to predicate mismatches creating unrealistic cascading failures
  - **After**: Realistic business failure rates (~0.5-2%) enabling proper load testing and performance analysis
  - **Performance Benefits**: Eliminates artificial query overhead from processing incorrectly structured failure events
- **Business Logic Verification**: Confirmed all command handler business rules match their GWT documentation with proper circulation validation, lending limits, and idempotency handling
- **Production Benefits**:
  - **Realistic Load Testing**: Enables creation of production-grade load generators with proper failure distributions
  - **Event Store Consistency**: Domain events now use consistent business identifier patterns across success and failure cases  
  - **Query Performance**: Proper predicate matching eliminates wasted query cycles on mismatched events

  - **Modern Go Patterns**: Replaced manual map-to-slice conversion with `slices.Collect(maps.Values())` using Go 1.24 stdlib
  - **Consistent Sorting**: Added chronological sorting - `BooksInCirculation` by `AddedAt`, lending queries by `LentAt`
  - **Architecture Consistency**: All query handlers now follow identical patterns for maintainability
- **Query Handlers Enhanced**:
  - **BooksInCirculation** (`booksincirculation/project.go`): Added complete book info, defensive existence checks, modern slice conversion, chronological sorting by `AddedAt`
  - **BooksLentByReader** (`bookslentbyreader/project.go`): Enhanced with defensive programming, complete book fields, modern patterns  
  - **BooksLentOut** (`bookslentout/project.go`): Updated with consistent patterns, complete book information, sorting by `LentAt`
