## Observability Code Readability Improvements
- **Completed**: 2025-08-02 12:03
- **Description**: Significant code readability improvements using observer patterns to reduce observability noise
- **Features**:
  - Metrics observer pattern - simplified metrics recording with queryMetricsObserver and appendMetricsObserver
  - Tracing observer pattern - encapsulated span lifecycle management
  - Reduced postgres.go complexity - observability calls simplified from 6+ calls to 2-3 simple observer calls
  - Maintained identical functionality - zero breaking changes to external API
  - Consistent patterns - all observability follows same observer pattern for maintainability
