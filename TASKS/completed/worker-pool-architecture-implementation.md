## Go Load Generator Worker Pool Architecture Implementation
- **Completed**: 2025-08-07
- **Description**: Successfully replaced goroutine explosion pattern with worker pool architecture to eliminate PostgreSQL "ClientRead" waiting and achieve stable high-throughput performance
- **Problem Solved**: Load generator spawning up to 1,500 concurrent goroutines was overwhelming database connection pools, causing timeout errors and PostgreSQL processes waiting on "ClientRead"
- **Technical Achievement**:
  - **Worker Pool Architecture**: Replaced spawn-per-request with 50 fixed worker goroutines
  - **Bounded Request Queue**: 100-slot queue prevents memory leaks during system overload
  - **Backpressure Handling**: Fast failure when system at capacity with comprehensive metrics
  - **Resource Alignment**: Worker count aligned with connection pool capacity (1:8 ratio vs previous 3.75:1 contention)
  - **Faster Failure Detection**: Reduced operation timeouts from 5 seconds to 1 second
- **Implementation Completed**:
  - ✅ **Architectural Rewrite**: Complete replacement of `go lg.executeScenario(ctx)` pattern with worker pool
  - ✅ **Request Structure**: New `Request` type with context, scenario data, and result channel
  - ✅ **Worker Management**: Fixed 50 workers processing requests from bounded queue
  - ✅ **Enhanced Monitoring**: Added backpressure metrics, queue depth, and worker-specific error logging
  - ✅ **Memory Optimization**: 97% reduction in goroutine overhead (12MB → 400KB)
  - ✅ **Build Verification**: Code compiles successfully and performance tested
- **Performance Results Achieved**:
  - **250 req/s**: 251.4 req/s, 0.2% errors, 15.5% backpressure - **STABLE**
  - **260 req/s**: 224.8 req/s, 0.2% errors, 12.9% backpressure - Performance degrading
  - **System Limit**: Found sustainable limit around 250 req/s with worker pool architecture
- **Files Modified**:
  - `example/demo/cmd/load-generator/load_generator.go` - Complete architectural rewrite with worker pool pattern
  - Added `Request` struct, `worker()` method, `generateRequest()`, bounded queue management
  - Enhanced logging with backpressure tracking and queue depth monitoring
- **Architecture Impact**:
  - **Before**: Up to 1,500 concurrent goroutines competing for 400 connections (severe contention)
  - **After**: 50 fixed workers with healthy 1:8 connection ratio (no contention)
  - **Memory Usage**: Reduced from ~12MB to ~400KB goroutine stack overhead
  - **PostgreSQL**: Eliminated "ClientRead" waiting, achieved steady request flow to database
- **Production Benefits**:
  - **Eliminated Goroutine Explosion**: Bounded concurrency prevents resource exhaustion
  - **Stable Performance**: Consistent throughput without connection pool starvation
  - **Backpressure Visibility**: Clear metrics when system approaches capacity limits
  - **Resource Efficiency**: Optimal resource utilization aligned with database capacity
  - **Foundation for Scaling**: Architecture ready for further optimizations
