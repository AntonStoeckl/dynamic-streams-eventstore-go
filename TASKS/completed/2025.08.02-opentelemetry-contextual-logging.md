## OpenTelemetry-Compatible Contextual Logging (Dependency-Free)
- **Completed**: 2025-08-02 14:30
- **Description**: Complete observability triad with context-aware logging following the same dependency-free pattern as metrics and tracing
- **Features**: 
  - ContextualLogger interface using only standard library types for maximum flexibility
  - Automatic trace correlation when tracing is enabled - logs include span context automatically
  - Complete instrumentation of Query and Append operations with contextual logging
  - Dual logging support - traditional Logger and ContextualLogger work simultaneously
  - TestContextualLogger with comprehensive testing infrastructure
  - Zero dependencies - users integrate with any logging backend (OpenTelemetry, structured loggers)
  - Example implementation showing OpenTelemetry integration patterns
  - Backward compatible - existing Logger interface unchanged
