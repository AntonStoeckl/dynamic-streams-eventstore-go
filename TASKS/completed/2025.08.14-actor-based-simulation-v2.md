## Actor-Based Simulation v2 - Complete Architecture Redesign
- **Created**: 2025-08-14 14:00
- **Started**: 2025-08-14 14:30
- **Completed**: 2025-08-16 02:20
- **Priority**: High - Revolutionary simulation architecture for realistic load testing
- **Objective**: Replace push-based rate limiting with actor-driven pull model that adapts to system performance

## Vision: Actor-Based Pull Model ‚úÖ ACHIEVED
- **Natural backpressure**: Actors work only as fast as the system allows
- **Realistic behavior**: Users adapt to system performance (slow down when overloaded)
- **True capacity discovery**: System finds natural limits without artificial constraints

## Architecture: Reader + Librarian Actors ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
- **14,000 readers** (100-500 active), **2 librarians** (acquisitions, maintenance)
- **Pull model**: Actors decide next task ‚Üí Wait for completion ‚Üí React to performance
- **Realistic patterns**: Library visits, returns, browsing, borrowing

**Reader Management** ‚úÖ:
- Below MinReaders ‚Üí Rapid registration
- Normal range ‚Üí Natural churn (70% register, 30% cancel)
- At MaxReaders ‚Üí Only cancellations

**Book Management** ‚úÖ:
- Below MinBooks ‚Üí Batch additions
- Above MaxBooks ‚Üí Remove available (unlent) books only

## Technical Implementation Plan ‚úÖ COMPLETE

### Directory Structure ‚úÖ
```
/example/simulation2/        # New implementation (preserve original)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tuning.go               # ALL tunable constants centralized
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.go                 # Entry point and orchestration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ actors.go               # Reader and Librarian implementations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scheduler.go            # Actor management and batch processing
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ state.go                # In-memory state for fast lookups
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ load_controller.go      # Auto-tuning system
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ handlers.go             # Command handler integration
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ config.go               # Configuration management
```

### Key Design Decisions ‚úÖ

#### 1. Batch Processing (Not Individual Goroutines) ‚úÖ
**Problem**: 14,000 goroutines would be inefficient
**Solution**: Process actors in batches of 50, single goroutine per batch
**Benefit**: Controlled concurrency, better CPU cache utilization

#### 2. Active/Inactive Reader Pools ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Not all readers visit library simultaneously
**Solution**: 100-500 active readers, ~13,500 inactive (at home)
**Management**: Rotate readers between pools based on visit patterns

#### 3. In-Memory State (Still Required) ‚úÖ
**Why needed**:
- Fast book availability checks (physical shelf browsing)
- Online browsing from home (wishlist creation)
- Min/max population enforcement
- Actor scheduling decisions

**Components**:
- Book availability map with pre-computed lists
- Reader borrowed books tracking
- Periodic refresh from EventStore (optimized to 2 seconds)

#### 4. Auto-Tuning Load Control ‚úÖ
**Monitoring**: P50/P99 latency, timeout rates
**Adjustment**: 
- Good performance ‚Üí +10 active readers
- High latency/timeouts ‚Üí -20 active readers
**Goal**: Find natural system capacity without artificial limits

## ‚úÖ Implementation Complete 
All core files created in `/example/simulation2/`: main.go, tuning.go, actors.go, state.go, scheduler.go, load_controller.go, handlers.go, config.go

## Issues Discovered & Fixed ‚úÖ

### üîß Data Quality Issues Found & Resolved
- **Orphaned lendings**: ~6,474 books lent to cancelled readers - cleanup tool created
- **Query timeout bug**: Fixed critical bug where queries returned partial results instead of errors
- **Actor initialization**: Fixed actor-state synchronization issues
- **P99 calculation bug**: Fixed measurement system returning maximum instead of 99th percentile
- **FIFO reader selection bug**: Fixed readers with books never getting activated

### üõ†Ô∏è Solutions Implemented
1. **‚úÖ Cleanup tool** (`example/cleanup/`) - fixes orphaned lendings
2. **‚úÖ Memory leak fixed** - removed problematic warmupConnectionPools function
3. **‚úÖ CRITICAL: Timeout bug fixed** - queries now return errors instead of partial results
4. **‚úÖ Measurement system fixed** - P99 calculations now accurate
5. **‚úÖ Actor synchronization fixed** - proper borrowed books tracking

## FINAL SUCCESS METRICS üéâ

### Query Consistency Achieved ‚úÖ
- **Before Fix**: 1,400+ discrepancy between queries
- **After Fix**: Perfect or near-perfect consistency (0-150 difference)
- **Book Count**: ~61,563 books, ~29,600 available consistently

### Performance Results ‚úÖ 
- **Throughput**: 11.7-67.4 ops/s (natural system capacity discovered)
- **Latency**: P50=67-80ms, P99=160-329ms (healthy, matches Grafana)
- **Operations**: Balanced lend/return operations
- **Auto-tuning**: Successfully found optimal reader counts (50-280 readers)
- **Grafana Correlation**: Perfect match with EventStore metrics

### Architectural Achievement ‚úÖ
‚úÖ **Actor-Based Pull Model**: System discovers natural capacity  
‚úÖ **Legacy Data Handling**: Million+ corrupted events processed correctly  
‚úÖ **State Consistency**: Queries now return consistent data  
‚úÖ **Immediate Availability**: Books available from startup  
‚úÖ **Production-Ready Output**: Clean, professional logging  
‚úÖ **Realistic Library Behavior**: Natural lending/return patterns  

## Key Lessons Learned

### 1. Event Sourcing Data Quality
**Issue**: Duplicate events and missing event handlers can create phantom state
**Solution**: Defensive programming with idempotent event processing
**Principle**: Always check `if _, exists := map[key]; !exists` before adding

### 2. Query Consistency in CQRS
**Issue**: Multiple projections can drift apart with corrupt data
**Solution**: Comprehensive event handling in all projections
**Validation**: Compare query results to detect inconsistencies

### 3. Initial State vs Periodic Refresh
**Issue**: Actors starting with empty state create poor user experience  
**Solution**: Load initial state synchronously before starting work
**Performance**: One-time cost for much better startup behavior

### 4. Measurement System Accuracy
**Issue**: Incorrect P99 calculations led to poor auto-tuning decisions
**Solution**: Proper percentile calculations and correlation with external metrics
**Validation**: Always cross-reference simulation metrics with production monitoring
