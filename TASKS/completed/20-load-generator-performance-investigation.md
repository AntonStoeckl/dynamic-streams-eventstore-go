## Load Generator Performance Investigation and Resolution
- **Completed**: 2025-08-04 02:40
- **Description**: Resolved critical performance issues in load generator that caused immediate context cancellations and 0% success rates
- **Problem Identified**: Load generator showing extremely slow performance with immediate context cancellations
- **Root Cause**: Context timeout configuration and goroutine management issues
- **Resolution**: Fixed context handling, database connection setup, and rate limiting implementation
- **Performance Achieved**: Restored expected ~2.5ms append performance matching benchmark tests
- **Result**: Load generator now operates at target rates with proper error handling and realistic library scenarios
