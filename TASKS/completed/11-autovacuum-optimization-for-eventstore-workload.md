## Autovacuum Optimization for EventStore Workload  
- **Completed**: 2025-08-07
- **Description**: Optimized PostgreSQL autovacuum settings for append-only EventStore workload to eliminate periodic timeout spikes and improve write consistency
- **Problem Solved**: Periodic timeout spikes on Append() operations caused by autovacuum blocking writes, performance degradation with growing database (447K+ events)
- **Technical Achievement**:
  - **EventStore-Specific Tuning**: Optimized for append-only workload with minimal dead tuples
  - **Master Optimization**: Vacuum rarely (80% threshold), ANALYZE frequently (2% threshold) 
  - **Replica Optimization**: Minimal vacuum (90% threshold), optimized ANALYZE (5% threshold)
  - **Write Performance**: Faster vacuum execution with reduced blocking time
  - **Query Optimization**: Frequent ANALYZE for JSONB query planning optimization
- **Implementation Completed**:
  - ✅ **Master Database Settings**: Updated `benchmarkdb-master-postgresql.conf`
    - `autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor = 0.8` (only vacuum at 80% dead tuples vs 10%)
    - `autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor = 0.02` (analyze at 2% changed tuples vs 5%)
    - `autovacuum_naptime = 2min` (more frequent checks but vacuum rarely)
    - `autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay = 2ms` (faster vacuum execution vs 10ms)
    - `autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit = 8000` (higher throughput vs 2000)
  - ✅ **Replica Database Settings**: Updated `benchmarkdb-replica-postgresql.conf`
    - `autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor = 0.9` (almost never vacuum on read-only)
    - `autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor = 0.05` (analyze at 5% for query performance)
    - `autovacuum_naptime = 10min` (less frequent checks on replica)
  - ✅ **Configuration Verification**: Settings applied and verified via PostgreSQL restart
- **EventStore Workload Optimization**:
  - **Append-Only Pattern**: Minimal dead tuples generated, vacuum rarely needed
  - **JSONB Query Performance**: Frequent ANALYZE critical for complex query optimization  
  - **Write Blocking Prevention**: Reduced vacuum frequency eliminates Append() timeouts
  - **Read Performance**: Optimized ANALYZE on replica for query planning
- **Expected Performance Impact**:
  - **Eliminate Periodic Timeout Spikes**: No more autovacuum blocking write operations
  - **Consistent Write Performance**: Stable Append() operations without vacuum interference  
  - **Improved Query Performance**: Frequent ANALYZE maintains optimal JSONB query plans
  - **Higher Sustainable Throughput**: Potential to achieve 300+ req/s without autovacuum bottlenecks
- **Production Benefits**:
  - **Write Consistency**: Append operations no longer blocked by aggressive vacuum cycles
  - **Scalable Architecture**: Optimized for growing EventStore databases
  - **Query Performance**: Maintained JSONB query optimization through strategic ANALYZE frequency
  - **Resource Efficiency**: Autovacuum resources focused where needed (ANALYZE vs vacuum)
