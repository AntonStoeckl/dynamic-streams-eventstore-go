## Query Handler Modernization and Enhancement  
- **Completed**: 2025-08-09
- **Description**: Modernized all 3 query handlers with defensive programming patterns, complete book information, and modern Go stdlib features for improved maintainability and consistency
- **Problem Solved**: Query handlers lacked defensive programming, complete book information, and used outdated map-to-slice conversion patterns
- **Technical Achievement**:
  - **Defensive Programming**: Enhanced query handlers to gracefully handle missing or inconsistent event data without panics
  - **Complete Book Information**: Added missing fields (`Edition`, `Publisher`, `PublicationYear`) to all query result structures
  - **Modern Go Patterns**: Replaced manual map-to-slice conversion with `slices.Collect(maps.Values())` using Go 1.24 stdlib
  - **Consistent Sorting**: Added chronological sorting - `BooksInCirculation` by `AddedAt`, lending queries by `LentAt`
  - **Architecture Consistency**: All query handlers now follow identical patterns for maintainability
- **Query Handlers Enhanced**:
  - **BooksInCirculation** (`booksincirculation/project.go`): Added complete book info, defensive existence checks, modern slice conversion, chronological sorting by `AddedAt`
  - **BooksLentByReader** (`bookslentbyreader/project.go`): Enhanced with defensive programming, complete book fields, modern patterns  
  - **BooksLentOut** (`bookslentout/project.go`): Updated with consistent patterns, complete book information, sorting by `LentAt`
- **Query Result Structures Extended**:
  - `BookInfo` struct: Added `Edition`, `Publisher`, `PublicationYear` fields for complete book metadata
  - `LendingInfo` struct: Added `Edition`, `Publisher`, `PublicationYear` fields for comprehensive lending details
  - `ReaderBookInfo` struct: Enhanced with missing book metadata fields
- **Modern Go Features Applied**:
  - **slices.Collect()**: Replaced `for range` loops with modern stdlib function for map-to-slice conversion
  - **slices.SortFunc()**: Used functional sorting with comparison functions for chronological ordering
  - **maps.Values()**: Leveraged modern stdlib for clean map value extraction
- **Defensive Programming Patterns**:
  - **Existence Checks**: All queries verify event data exists before accessing fields
  - **Graceful Degradation**: Missing book details don't crash queries, allowing projection of available data
  - **Consistent Error Handling**: Uniform approach to handling incomplete or malformed event histories
- **Benefits Achieved**:
  - **Production Resilience**: Query handlers gracefully handle "broken" or incomplete event histories from system evolution
  - **Complete Data Projection**: Users get full book information in all query responses
  - **Modern Codebase**: Up-to-date Go patterns improve maintainability and readability
  - **Consistent Architecture**: Identical patterns across all query handlers reduce cognitive load for developers
