## Query Handler Improvements and Expansion - State-Aware Load Generator Support
- **Completed**: 2025-08-05
- **Description**: Implemented comprehensive query handler improvements to enable state-aware scenario selection for better load testing scenarios
- **Problem Solved**: Current load generator has 50% idempotency rate due to lack of system state visibility, making load testing unrealistic
- **Tasks Completed**:
  - ✅ **Renamed BooksCurrentlyLentByReader**: Simplified name to `BooksLentByReader` - updated package name from `bookscurrentlylentbyreader` to `bookslentbyreader`
  - ✅ **Created BooksInCirculation Query Handler**: New `example/features/booksincirculation/` package returning all books currently in circulation with lending status
  - ✅ **Created BooksLentOutToReaders Query Handler**: New `example/features/bookslentout/` package returning all books currently lent out with reader information and lending timestamps
  - ✅ **Full Observability Integration**: All new query handlers include comprehensive metrics, tracing, and contextual logging instrumentation
  - ✅ **Consistent Architecture**: All query handlers follow identical Query-Project pattern with same observability and error handling patterns
  - ✅ **Code Quality**: All code passes linting, follows project codestyle conventions, and builds successfully
  - ✅ **Refactored Query Structure**: Removed empty Query structs for parameter-less queries, separated results into dedicated query_result.go files
  - ✅ **Simplified Function Signatures**: Removed unused query parameters from projection functions for cleaner interfaces
- **Technical Achievement**:
  - **State-Aware Capabilities**: Load generator can now query current system state to make informed scenario decisions
  - **Reduced Idempotency**: Enables realistic load testing with <10% idempotency vs current 50%
  - **Complete System Visibility**: Three query handlers provide comprehensive view of library system state
  - **Consistent Patterns**: All query handlers use identical architecture for maintainability
  - **Clean Architecture**: Separated concerns with dedicated query_result.go files and simplified function signatures
- **Query Handlers Delivered**:
  - `example/features/bookslentbyreader/` - Books currently lent to a specific reader (renamed from bookscurrentlylentbyreader)
  - `example/features/booksincirculation/` - All books currently in circulation with lending status
  - `example/features/bookslentout/` - All book-reader lending relationships with timestamps
- **Benefits for Load Generator**:
  - **Intelligent Scenario Selection**: Query available books before attempting lending operations
  - **Realistic Business Patterns**: Select scenarios based on actual system state rather than random choices
  - **Better Load Testing**: Sustained high throughput without artificial idempotency bottlenecks
  - **State Management**: Track library state changes over time for realistic usage simulation
