## Complete Feature Implementation for Library Domain (Prerequisites for Load Generator)
- **Completed**: 2025-08-03 16:46
- **Description**: Implemented all missing example features required for load generator with comprehensive code quality improvements
- **Tasks Completed**:
  - ✅ Created `example/features/addbookcopy/` - AddBookCopyToCirculation feature
  - ✅ Created `example/features/lendbookcopytoreader/` - LendBookCopyToReader feature  
  - ✅ Created `example/features/returnbookcopyfromreader/` - ReturnBookCopyFromReader feature
  - ✅ Applied TimingCollector integration to all new features
  - ✅ Implemented comprehensive business rules with GIVEN/WHEN/THEN/ERROR/IDEMPOTENCY documentation
  - ✅ Applied state struct pattern with project() function for clean event replay logic
  - ✅ Converted all features from string-based to concrete type switching for type safety
  - ✅ Eliminated all nested if statements and double negatives for maximum readability
  - ✅ Applied positive logic pattern consistently (bookIsNotInCirculation vs !bookIsInCirculation)
  - ✅ Initialized all state fields explicitly in project() functions with descriptive comments
- **Code Quality Achievements**:
  - **Consistent Architecture**: All features follow identical Command-Query-Decide-Append pattern
  - **Type Safety**: Concrete event type switching eliminates runtime string comparison errors
  - **Readability**: Positive logic throughout, idempotency cases first, comments aligned right
  - **Documentation**: Business rules clearly documented in natural language format
  - **Testing Guidance**: Unit testing recommendations moved to package-level documentation
