## Realistic Load Generator Simulation - Issue Fixes
- **Completed**: 2025-08-09 (review confirmed)
- **Description**: Fixed multiple critical issues in the library simulation load generator to enable realistic testing
- **Problems Solved**: No lending in first run, unrealistic scenario distribution, missing statistics, unnecessary pauses

### Issues Fixed
1. **Lending Relationships Tracking**: 
   - State tracking verified working correctly
   - Lending state properly initialized from BooksLentOut query
   
2. **Scenario Distribution Adjusted**:
   - Weights changed: LendBook 200, ReturnBook 180, QueryBooks 10
   - Book operations: 1-3 weight (was 5-15)
   - Reader operations: 1-5 weight (was 3)
   - Now 85-90% of operations are lending/returning
   
3. **Enhanced Lending Statistics**:
   - Added completedLendings counter to state
   - Track completed lendings on every return operation
   - Output shows: "X active lendings, Y completed lendings (total: Z)"

4. **Conditional Setup Pause**:
   - Modified `setupInitialState()` to return boolean indicating if setup was performed
   - Only sleep 60s for Grafana visibility when books/readers were actually added
   - Skip pause on subsequent runs when state already meets requirements

5. **State Updates During Setup**:
   - Fixed critical bug where state wasn't updated during setup phase
   - Now updates state.AddBook() and state.AddReader() after successful setup operations
   - Lending scenarios now properly execute in first run since state tracks books/readers

### Files Modified
- `example/simulation/cmd/state.go` - Added completedLendings tracking with GetDetailedStats()
- `example/simulation/cmd/scenarios.go` - Adjusted weights for 85-90% lending operations
- `example/simulation/cmd/simulation.go` - Enhanced output, conditional pause, state updates during setup

### Result
- First run now shows lending activity immediately after setup
- Realistic operation distribution with lending/returning dominating
- Detailed statistics for monitoring simulation behavior
- No unnecessary delays on subsequent runs
