## CLAUDE.md Improvements and Development Policies
- **Completed**: 2025-08-09  
- **Description**: Enhanced CLAUDE.md with better task management workflow, binary execution policies, and content optimization
- **Problem Solved**: Missing development policies and overly verbose guidance documentation

### Implementation Completed
- ✅ **Task Management Workflow**: Added requirement for "review pending" before completion
- ✅ **Binary Execution Policy**: Never run compiled binaries without user permission  
- ✅ **CLAUDE.md Evolution**: Reminder to ask about missing information
- ✅ **Content Compaction**: Reduced file size by ~25-30% while maintaining critical information
- ✅ **Reference Optimization**: Moved detailed content to codestyle.md and docs/

### Key Policies Added

**Task Review Workflow:**
```
1. Complete implementation
2. Mark task as "review pending" in TodoWrite  
3. Wait for explicit user approval before moving to completed
```

**Binary Execution Policy:**
- Never run compiled binaries without explicit user permission
- Always ask user to run executables instead
- Exception: `go build` allowed for verification
- Cleanup: Always delete binaries after building

**Evolution Reminder:**
- Ask user when information would be helpful to add to CLAUDE.md
- Keeps guidance comprehensive and up-to-date

### Content Optimization
- **Removed duplicates**: Code style details moved to codestyle.md reference
- **Simplified sections**: Condensed makefile commands, database schema, constants
- **Streamlined patterns**: Kept essential architectural notes, removed verbose examples
- **Merged conventions**: Combined similar communication items

### Files Modified
- `CLAUDE.md` - Enhanced with policies, compacted content, improved organization
- Updated session setup reminders for new TASKS structure
- Added comprehensive binary execution and cleanup policies

### Benefits Achieved
- **Clear development policies**: No ambiguity about binary execution and task completion
- **Better organization**: More focused, scannable content  
- **Improved workflow**: Explicit review process prevents premature task completion
- **Content efficiency**: ~30% size reduction while maintaining all critical guidance
- **Future evolution**: Built-in mechanism for keeping guidance current

### Result
CLAUDE.md is now a focused, policy-driven development guide with clear workflows and comprehensive project-specific guidance while avoiding duplication with other documentation files.
