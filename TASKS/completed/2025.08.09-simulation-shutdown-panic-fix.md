## Simulation Shutdown Panic Fix
- **Completed**: 2025-08-09
- **Description**: Fixed "send on closed channel" panic during Ctrl+C shutdown of library simulation
- **Problem Solved**: Race condition between shutdown sequence and worker result channel operations causing panic

### Root Cause Analysis
- **Race Condition**: Main loop exited immediately on Ctrl+C while workers still processed requests
- **Channel Panic**: Workers tried to send results to closed/unreachable channels
- **No Coordination**: Missing synchronization between shutdown signal and worker cleanup

### Problem Flow
1. Ctrl+C triggered context cancellation
2. Main loop exited immediately when `ctx.Done()`
3. Workers continued processing requests
4. Workers tried `request.resultChan <- err` → **Panic: send on closed channel**

### Implementation Completed
- ✅ **Graceful Shutdown Sequence**: Main loop now closes request queue and waits for workers
- ✅ **Safe Channel Operations**: Protected result sending with fallback cases
- ✅ **Proper Coordination**: Workers finish current requests before main loop exits
- ✅ **Improved Stop() Method**: Removed double-closing of request queue

### Technical Changes

**Graceful Main Loop Shutdown:**
```go
case <-ctx.Done():
    close(ls.requestQueue)  // Signal workers to stop
    ls.wg.Wait()           // Wait for workers to finish
    return ctx.Err()       // Clean exit
```

**Safe Result Channel Sending:**
```go
select {
case request.resultChan <- err:  // Normal case
case <-ctx.Done():              // Context cancelled
default:                        // Channel closed/blocked - no panic
}
```

### Files Modified
- `example/simulation/cmd/simulation.go` - Enhanced shutdown coordination and safe channel operations

### Shutdown Sequence
1. Ctrl+C → context.Done() → Main loop receives signal
2. Main loop closes requestQueue → Workers see closed channel  
3. Main loop waits → All workers finish current requests
4. Workers exit cleanly → No channel operations
5. Main loop returns → Clean shutdown

### Result
- ✅ **No more shutdown panics** when pressing Ctrl+C
- ✅ **Graceful worker termination** with proper cleanup
- ✅ **Robust concurrent shutdown** handling race conditions
