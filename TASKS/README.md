# TASKS Directory

This directory tracks tasks for the Dynamic Event Streams EventStore project, organized by status.

## Structure

### 📁 `completed/`
Individual files for each completed task, containing implementation details, results, and completion dates.

### 📁 `in-progress/`
Current active work items. Each task includes status updates, progress tracking, and implementation plans.

### 📁 `ready-to-implement/`
Planned improvements and features ready for implementation, with detailed requirements and success criteria.

### 📄 `future-ideas.md`
High-level concepts and ideas for future consideration (kept minimal).

## Usage

- **Starting new work**: Check `ready-to-implement/` for planned tasks
- **Active work**: Track progress in `in-progress/` files
- **Completed work**: Reference implementation details in `completed/` files
- **Session continuity**: Review active tasks at session start for context

## Task Lifecycle

1. **Planning**: Ideas start in `future-ideas.md` or directly in `ready-to-implement/`
2. **Implementation**: Move to `in-progress/` when work begins
3. **Review**: Mark as "review pending" when implementation complete
4. **Completion**: Move to `completed/` after user approval

Each task is now in its own file for better organization and readability.
