## Minimal Observability Testing Strategy
- **Created**: 2025-08-30 15:30
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Objective**: Design minimal observability testing approach that doesn't explode test complexity

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement

We successfully simplified command handler integration tests by removing observability complexity. Now we need to rethink observability testing strategy:

**Current Situation**:
- Command handlers: 3 tests each (Success, Error, Idempotent) - NO observability
- Query handlers: 2 tests each (Plain, Snapshot) - NO observability  
- EventStore: Has observability wrapper capability
- Need: Validate observability works without test explosion

**Anti-Pattern to Avoid**:
- Query handlers with 4 tests: Plain, Plain+Obs, Snapshot, Snapshot+Obs
- Command handlers with 6 tests: Success, Success+Obs, Error, Error+Obs, Idempotent, Idempotent+Obs

## ðŸ¤” Key Questions

1. **Where to test observability?** 
   - At the wrapper level (unit tests)?
   - At the handler level (integration tests)?
   - Separate observability integration tests?

2. **How much observability testing?**
   - One representative test per handler type?
   - One comprehensive observability test suite?
   - Minimal smoke tests only?

3. **What observability aspects to test?**
   - Metrics collection (counters, timings)?
   - Tracing spans (creation, attributes)?
   - Logging (structured, contextual)?
   - All three together?

## ðŸ’­ Potential Approaches

### Approach 1: Separate Observability Test Suite
- Keep current handler tests clean (no observability)
- Create dedicated `*_observability_test.go` files
- Test observability wrapper behavior in isolation
- Pro: Clean separation, no test explosion
- Con: Less integration coverage

### Approach 2: One Observability Test Per Handler
- Keep 2-3 main tests without observability
- Add 1 additional test with full observability
- Focus on "happy path + observability" only
- Pro: Some integration coverage, controlled growth
- Con: Still increases test count by ~33%

### Approach 3: Observability-Only Integration Tests
- Keep handler tests focused on business logic
- Create separate integration tests that ONLY test observability
- Use minimal business scenarios to drive observability
- Pro: Clear purpose separation
- Con: Potential duplication of setup

### Approach 4: Wrapper-Level Testing Only
- Test observability at EventStore wrapper level
- Assume if wrapper works, handlers inherit observability
- No handler-level observability tests
- Pro: Minimal tests, focused testing
- Con: No end-to-end observability validation

## ðŸŽ¯ Recommended Analysis

Need to investigate:
1. **Current EventStore observability wrapper** - How does it work?
2. **Query handler observability wrapping** - Is this implemented?
3. **Existing observability tests** - What patterns already exist?
4. **Observability failure modes** - What could break and how to detect?

## ðŸ“‹ Implementation Strategy

1. **Research Phase**:
   - Analyze existing observability implementation
   - Review EventStore wrapper patterns
   - Identify minimal test requirements

2. **Design Phase**:
   - Choose approach based on existing patterns
   - Define observability test template
   - Ensure consistent with project architecture

3. **Implementation Phase**:
   - Implement chosen approach
   - Update existing tests if needed
   - Document observability testing guidelines

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Criteria

- Observability testing strategy defined
- No explosion of test complexity (avoid 2x-4x test growth)
- Adequate coverage of observability integration
- Consistent with project's Vertical Slice Architecture
- Maintainable and focused tests
