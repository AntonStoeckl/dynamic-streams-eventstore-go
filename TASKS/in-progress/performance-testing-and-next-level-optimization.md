## Performance Testing and Next-Level Optimization
- **Started**: 2025-08-07  
- **Priority**: Medium - System stability achieved, exploring higher performance limits
- **Objective**: Test autovacuum optimizations and identify next bottlenecks for pushing beyond 250 req/sec sustainable performance

### Root Cause Analysis Complete ✅
**Problem**: Load generator at 300 req/sec experiencing context deadline exceeded timeouts

**Key Findings from Database Statistics**:
- **Resource Allocation Mismatch**: Replica (handling 3.1x more load) has 2.3x less memory than master
- **Connection Imbalance**: Replica: 81 connections vs Master: 18 connections (4.5x difference)
- **Load Distribution**: Replica 950K commits vs Master 303K commits due to read/write splitting
- **Read/Write Pattern**: All SELECT queries route to replica (3GB), all INSERT to master (7GB)

**Database Statistics Summary**:
```
MASTER (7GB, port 5433):  18 connections, 303K commits, 100% cache hit, under-utilized
REPLICA (3GB, port 5434): 81 connections, 950K commits, 100% cache hit, over-loaded
REPLICATION: 8ms lag, healthy streaming replication, 0.139s behind master
```

**PostgreSQL Specialist Analysis**: 
- Connection pool exhaustion on replica (81 connections with 3GB RAM)
- Memory pressure from connection overhead (~5-10MB per connection)
- Resource allocation inverse to actual load pattern
- Both pools configured for 200 max connections but load heavily read-biased

### Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1: Memory Reallocation (In Progress)
**Objective**: Swap memory allocation to match actual load distribution
- **Master**: 7GB → 4GB (sufficient for write workload)
- **Replica**: 3GB → 6GB (needed for heavy read workload)
- **Docker Configuration**: Update docker-compose.yml memory limits
- **PostgreSQL Tuning**: Update shared_buffers, effective_cache_size, work_mem accordingly
- **Expected Impact**: 40-60% improvement in query response times

#### Phase 2: Connection Pool Optimization (Future)
**Objective**: Reduce connection pressure on replica
- Replica: 200 → 40 max connections
- Master: 200 → 20 max connections  
- **Expected Impact**: 30-50% reduction in connection timeouts

#### Phase 3: Configuration Fine-tuning (Future)
**Objective**: Optimize PostgreSQL settings for read vs write workloads
- Replica: Optimize for concurrent reads, larger work_mem, query-friendly settings
- Master: Optimize for writes, WAL settings, checkpoint tuning
- **Expected Impact**: 20-30% overall performance improvement

### Current Status
- ✅ **Investigation Complete**: Comprehensive database statistics gathered from master and replica
- ✅ **Root Cause Identified**: Resource allocation mismatch and connection pool imbalance
- ✅ **Specialist Analysis**: PostgreSQL performance expert provided detailed optimization plan  
- ✅ **Phase 1 Implementation**: Memory reallocation completed (4GB master, 6GB replica)
- ✅ **Configuration Validation**: New PostgreSQL settings applied and verified
- ✅ **Replication Status**: Streaming replication working normally after restart

### Files Modified ✅
- ✅ `testutil/postgresengine/docker-compose.yml` - Updated memory limits (Master: 4096M, Replica: 6144M)
- ✅ `testutil/postgresengine/tuning/benchmarkdb-master-postgresql.conf` - Updated for 4GB allocation
  - shared_buffers: 1024MB, effective_cache_size: 2400MB, work_mem: 64MB, maintenance_work_mem: 256MB
- ✅ `testutil/postgresengine/tuning/benchmarkdb-replica-postgresql.conf` - Updated for 6GB allocation  
  - shared_buffers: 1536MB, effective_cache_size: 3600MB, work_mem: 96MB, maintenance_work_mem: 384MB

### Verification Completed ✅
- **Memory Configuration**: All PostgreSQL settings correctly applied and verified
- **Container Health**: All containers healthy and running
- **Replication Status**: Streaming replication active (state: streaming, sync_state: async)
- **Resource Allocation**: Master now has 4GB (sufficient for writes), Replica has 6GB (needed for heavy reads)

### Success Criteria
- Load generator runs at 300 req/sec without timeout errors
- Connection distribution balanced appropriately
- Both databases maintain 100% cache hit ratio
- Replication lag remains under 10ms
- Overall query response time improvement of 40%+
