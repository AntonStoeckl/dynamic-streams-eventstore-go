## Simulation Architecture Simplification
- **Created**: 2025-08-19 21:35
- **Started**: 2025-08-19 21:35
- **Priority**: High
- **Objective**: Radically simplify simulation architecture by unifying batch processing and auto-tuning into single sequential loop

## 🎯 Core Insight
Since batches already run sequentially (after pile-up fix) and there's no actual state refresh, we can eliminate complex synchronization and create a single main loop with immediate feedback.

## 📋 Implementation Plan

### **Phase 1: Create Unified Simulation Loop**
1. **🔧 Create new `simulation.go`** with unified simulation struct
   - Single main loop replacing scheduler + load controller
   - Direct metrics calculation from batch processing
   - Immediate auto-tuning feedback (1s vs 5s delay)

2. **📊 Simplify metrics collection**
   - Keep last 10 batches only (1 second window)  
   - Calculate P50/P99 directly - no complex history
   - Remove all async RecordLatency/RecordTimeout calls

3. **⚡ Single loop structure**
   ```
   Every cycle:
   - Rotate active readers
   - Process batch → get metrics
   - Record metrics
   
   Every 1s (10 cycles):
   - Calculate P50/P99
   - Auto-tune reader count
   
   Every 500ms (5 cycles):
   - Process librarians
   
   Immediate when needed:
   - Adjust reader population
   ```

### **Phase 2: Remove Unnecessary Components**
1. **❌ Delete these goroutines:**
   - `refreshState()` - doesn't actually refresh (ShouldRefresh always false)
   - `verifyLibrarianState()` - already disabled (expensive query)
   - `LoadController` - entire component becomes inline
   - `managePopulation()` goroutine - make immediate

2. **🧹 Eliminate synchronization**
   - No mutexes between components
   - No channels between scheduler/controller
   - Direct access to metrics

### **Phase 3: File Structure Cleanup**
1. **📁 New structure:**
   ```
   simulation2/
   ├── main.go           (update to use UnifiedSimulation)
   ├── simulation.go     (NEW - unified loop)  
   ├── actors.go         (unchanged)
   ├── handlers.go       (unchanged)
   ├── state.go          (remove ShouldRefresh)
   ├── tuning.go         (merge all constants)
   └── [DELETE] scheduler.go, load_controller.go
   ```

## 📈 Expected Improvements

| Component | Before | After | Benefit |
|-----------|--------|-------|---------|
| **Goroutines** | 7+ | 1 | -85% complexity |
| **Mutex locks** | ~10/batch | 0 | No synchronization! |
| **Auto-tune delay** | 5 seconds | 1 second | 5x faster |
| **Code files** | 5 | 3 | -40% files |
| **Lines of code** | ~2000 | ~600 | -70% reduction |
| **Mental model** | Complex async | Simple loop | Much clearer |

## 🔧 Implementation Strategy
1. Create new `simulation.go` alongside existing code
2. Test new implementation thoroughly  
3. Switch `main.go` to use new simulation
4. Delete old scheduler.go and load_controller.go

## 🚀 **LATEST UPDATE: Concurrent Processing Enhancement**

**User requested lightweight concurrency using ActorBatchSize=5:**

### **✅ IMPLEMENTED:**
1. **🔧 Concurrent batch processing** 
   - Process readers in groups of 5 (`ActorBatchSize`) 
   - Multiple goroutines instead of sequential processing
   - Added `processReaderGroup()` method for goroutine coordination

2. **📊 Safe result collection**
   - `batchResult` struct for metrics from concurrent groups
   - Buffered channel with proper cleanup
   - `sync.WaitGroup` coordination between goroutines

3. **⏱️ Timeout handling**
   - Context cancellation handled in `processReaderGroup` 
   - Batch timeout detection during result collection
   - Graceful handling when goroutines can't send results

4. **🛡️ Thread safety**
   - Channel-based communication between goroutines
   - No shared state mutations between groups
   - Proper goroutine lifecycle management

### **📋 Code Changes:**
- **simulation.go**: Modified `processBatch()` to use concurrent goroutines
- **simulation.go**: Added `processReaderGroup()` method
- **Compilation**: ✅ Verified - builds without errors

## 🧪 **REVIEW PENDING**
- Implementation complete and builds successfully
- Ready for user testing with ActorBatchSize=5 concurrent processing
- Maintains same business logic while improving performance
- **Awaiting user approval before marking as completed**

## 🚨 **CRITICAL BUG DISCOVERED: Concurrent Processing is Backwards!**
- **Created**: 2025-08-20 11:40
- **Issue**: The current implementation creates WAY TOO MANY goroutines!
- **Problem**: With ActorBatchSize=1, we get 220 goroutines (one per reader) running in parallel
- **Result**: Completely overwhelms the EventStore instead of controlling concurrency

### **Problem Analysis**
The current implementation is **completely backwards**:
- `ActorBatchSize = 1` creates 220 goroutines (one per reader)
- All goroutines run in parallel, overwhelming the EventStore
- The smaller the batch size, the MORE concurrency (opposite of intended)

### **🔧 Worker Pool Implementation with Channels (3 Workers)**

#### **Current Mutex Analysis**
✅ **Good news**: No unnecessary mutexes!
- `SimulationState` has `sync.RWMutex` (needed - shared between handlers)
- `UnifiedSimulation` has NO mutexes (single-threaded design)
- We'll use **channels** for worker coordination, not locks

#### **1. Rename Constant** (tuning.go line 101-102)
```go
// MaxConcurrentWorkers defines the number of worker goroutines
// This limits concurrent requests to the EventStore (was ActorBatchSize)
MaxConcurrentWorkers = 3  // Start with 3 workers
```

#### **2. Rewrite processBatch** (simulation.go line 275-375)
```go
func (s *UnifiedSimulation) processBatch(cycleNum int64) BatchMetrics {
    // ... existing setup ...
    
    // Create channels for work distribution (no locks needed!)
    numWorkers := MaxConcurrentWorkers
    if numWorkers > len(s.activeReaders) {
        numWorkers = len(s.activeReaders)
    }
    
    readerChan := make(chan *ReaderActor, len(s.activeReaders))
    resultChan := make(chan batchResult, numWorkers)
    
    // Queue all readers
    for _, reader := range s.activeReaders {
        readerChan <- reader
    }
    close(readerChan) // Signal no more work
    
    // Start exactly 3 workers
    var wg sync.WaitGroup
    for i := 0; i < numWorkers; i++ {
        wg.Add(1)
        go s.processWorker(batchCtx, readerChan, resultChan, cycleNum, &wg)
    }
    
    // Wait and collect results
    go func() {
        wg.Wait()
        close(resultChan)
    }()
    
    // Collect from channel (no locks!)
    for result := range resultChan {
        // accumulate metrics...
    }
}
```

#### **3. New processWorker Method**
```go
func (s *UnifiedSimulation) processWorker(
    ctx context.Context, 
    readers <-chan *ReaderActor,  // receive-only channel
    results chan<- batchResult,   // send-only channel
    cycleNum int64,
    wg *sync.WaitGroup,
) {
    defer wg.Done()
    
    result := batchResult{
        operationLatencies: make([]time.Duration, 0),
    }
    
    // Pull from channel until empty or cancelled
    for reader := range readers {
        // Check context BEFORE processing
        if ctx.Err() != nil {
            result.timeoutCount++
            continue
        }
        
        // Process reader...
        
        // Check context AFTER processing too
        if ctx.Err() != nil {
            break // Stop processing on timeout
        }
    }
    
    // Send accumulated result
    select {
    case results <- result:
    case <-ctx.Done():
        // Context cancelled, don't block
    }
}
```

### **Key Design Decisions**

1. **Channels over Mutexes**:
   - Work queue: buffered channel with all readers
   - Results: channel for collecting worker results
   - No shared mutable state between workers

2. **Context Handling**:
   - Check `ctx.Err()` before AND after each reader
   - Non-blocking send on result channel with select
   - Graceful shutdown on cancellation

3. **No New Mutexes Needed**:
   - Workers don't share state (each has own result)
   - SimulationState already thread-safe with RWMutex
   - Channels handle all coordination

### **Expected Behavior**
- 3 workers process 220 readers (~73 each)
- Max 3 concurrent EventStore requests
- Batches complete in 15-40 seconds
- Clean timeout at 60 seconds
- No goroutine leaks
- No unnecessary locking

### **✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED**
- **Completed**: 2025-08-20 14:45
- ✅ Renamed `ActorBatchSize` to `MaxConcurrentWorkers` (value: 3)
- ✅ Replaced backward concurrent processing with proper worker pool
- ✅ Implemented channel-based work distribution (no locks!)
- ✅ Added proper context cancellation handling 
- ✅ Verified no unnecessary mutexes in UnifiedSimulation
- ✅ Compilation successful - ready for testing

### **Key Changes Made:**
1. **tuning.go line 101-103**: Renamed constant with clear documentation
2. **simulation.go processBatch()**: Complete rewrite with worker pool pattern
3. **simulation.go processWorker()**: New method replacing processReaderGroup
4. **main.go line 233**: Updated logging to show concurrent workers

### **Result:**
- Max 3 concurrent EventStore requests (was 220!)
- Channel-based coordination (no shared mutable state)
- Proper timeout handling with early exit
- Clean goroutine lifecycle management

**Status**: **IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE - AWAITING USER TESTING**

## 🔧 **LINTER ISSUES FIXED**
- **Completed**: 2025-08-20 15:30
- **Fixed processBatch funlen**: 65 lines → 29 lines (extracted `executeWorkerPool` and `logBatchCompletion`)
- **Fixed adjustActiveReaderCount cognitive complexity**: 35 → ~20 (extracted `selectReaderFromInactive`)
- **Result**: Reduced from 3 linter issues to 1 (only main.go funlen remains - acceptable)

### **Refactoring Benefits:**
1. **Eliminated Code Duplication**: Reader selection logic now reused
2. **Better Separation of Concerns**: Clear method responsibilities
3. **Maintained Readability**: No over-abstraction, logical grouping

## 🐛 **CRITICAL BUG FIXED: BooksLentOut Never Updated**
- **Completed**: 2025-08-20 15:45
- **Issue**: `BooksLentOut` stat was frozen at startup value, never updated during runtime
- **Root Cause**: `LendBook()` and `ReturnBook()` updated `ActiveLendings` but not `BooksLentOut`

### **Fix Applied:**
**In state.go LendBook() (line 317):**
```go
s.stats.BooksLentOut = s.totalActiveLendings
```

**In state.go ReturnBook() (line 355):**
```go
s.stats.BooksLentOut = s.totalActiveLendings
```

### **Benefits:**
- ✅ `BooksLentOut` now updates in real-time during lending operations
- ✅ No new locks needed (already inside existing mutex)
- ✅ Consistent with DB truth (should start near 12718 and change)
- ✅ Zero performance impact

**Status**: **ALL IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE - READY FOR USER TESTING**

## 🚀 **MAJOR USER REFACTORING COMPLETED**
- **Completed**: 2025-08-20 16:00

  - `gracefulShutdown(simulation)` - Clean shutdown handling

#### **5. Context and Error Handling Improvements**
- **Enhanced timeout logging**: Better context metadata tracking
- **Missing newlines fixed**: File formatting improvements
- **Method signature consistency**: Config parameter threading throughout

### **Benefits of User Changes:**
1. **Runtime Configurability**: Worker count adjustable via Config
2. **Better Code Organization**: Clear separation of initialization phases
3. **Improved Logging**: More detailed configuration and status reporting
4. **Cleaner Architecture**: Proper parameter passing vs global constants
5. **Enhanced Maintainability**: Clear method responsibilities

### **Configuration Flow:**
```
